    <p>This recipe is a new take on the classic asian dish, and it is made even simpler by incorporating an Instant Pot.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>¾ cup orange juice</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup blackstrap molasses</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 orange, zested and juiced, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice wine</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blot chicken with paper towels until completely dry. Cut into 1- to 2-inch chunks.</li>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®), select Saute function, and click to adjust to the highest heat. When the pot is hot, add oil and heat until shimmering. Add chicken and saute until it starts to get golden, stirring
            constantly so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot, for 2 to 3 minutes.Pour 3/4 cup orange juice into the pot and bring to a boil while scraping all the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. </li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce, sugar, molasses, soy sauce, garlic, orange zest, ginger, and rice wine; gently stir until all ingredients are combined and coated in sauce. Cancel Saute function.</li>
        <li>Close and lock the lid, and make sure the vent is closed. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Allow the Instant Pot® to remain on for 10 minutes with the Keep Warm function. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Select Saute function
            and click to adjust to the lowest heat.</li>
        <li>Combine 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice with cornstarch in a medium bowl; whisk until combined with no lumps. Add to the Instant Pot® and stir to combine. Cook, stirring gently, until sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Simmer for 2 to
            3 minutes more</li>
        <li>Cancel Saute function and let stand until sauce thickens further, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
